const letConstVar = `
    1,Breakup with var, we don't use var anymore.Because var can be used for reassign and redefined.
    2,Let can be reassign but can not be redefined.
    3,Const can not reassign or redefined.
        -that's why we understand that if we need to reassign then use let and we didn't any reassign then we use const.
